# WD107/ZD107 Deploying Event-Driven Applications with IBM Event Streams on IBM Cloud Private

This is the repository for IBM Event Streams curriculum development.  

## Remote lab environment access

This course provides hands-on experience with IBM Event Streams on IBM Cloud Private. The lab exercises in this course are intended to run in a remote environment where IBM Cloud Private is already installed and configured.

For instructor-led deliveries, the instructor provides the URL for students to access this environment. For self-paced virtual courses (SPVC), the URL is provided by the Digital Learning Platform (DLP). 

Instructors must go through proper channels to request provisioning of the lab environment for classroom deliveries.

## Student materials
All of the materials that students need for the course are contained in the PDFs folder here, and they are also accessible via [https://github.com/ibm-learning-skills-dev/LearnIBMEventStreams](https://github.com/ibm-learning-skills-dev/LearnIBMEventStreams).
