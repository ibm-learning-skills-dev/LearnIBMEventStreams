# Learn IBM Event Streams
This repository contains files that are used in the course, WD107/ZD107 Deploying Event-Driven Applications with IBM Event Streams on IBM Cloud Private. 

This course provides hands-on experience with IBM Event Streams on IBM Cloud Private. The lab exercises are intended to run in a remote environment where IBM Cloud Private is already installed and configured.

For instructor-led deliveries, the instructor provides the URL for students to access this environment. For self-paced virtual courses (SPVC), the URL is provided by the Digital Learning Platform (DLP).
